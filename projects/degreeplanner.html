   <h3>Project Description</h3>
   <p>
    During my third-year at Rose, I've been working as part of a large-scale, year long software development project, using agile methodologies, as best as possible when applied to an academic schedule.  The degree planner helps students create multi-year plans for their studies at Rose-Hulman.  The plans include classes the students want to take.  Students can request various operations on their plans, including: populating a default plan (as defined by the school), evaluating what classes they still need to graduate, and determine the validity of the plan by verifying prerequisites are fulfilled.
  </p>

  <p>
    The project is spread across three terms (Rose uses a three term academic year) for a group of approximately 20 students, divided into teams of three to five.  The first term involved requirements gathering from clients.  Our clients were two professors in the Computer Science and Software Engineering (CSSE) department at Rose.  The second term was focused on developing the system in iterations using scrum.  The final term will finalize development and provide a simulation of working with legacy code, including refactoring and improving the code base.
  </p>

  <h3>Team User Interface</h3>
  <p>
    I am a member of the user interface team; the team charged with developing all user facing portions of the system.  We are developing a web application using ASP.NET that uses RESTful services developed by the other teams to interact with the system.
  </p>

  <p>
    We learned about object oriented design and analysis and applied the principles to the project during design and development.  We utilized object oriented design patterns and principles to improve the system as we developed it.  Some of the applied patterns include: adapters, factories, commands, states, and many others.  Unfortunately, as the project was for real clients and I don't hold any rights to the code, I am not at liberty to share detailed information regarding the system's design and implementation.
